# Alm_utilWorkLog

An almost working version of 

Docu files and a Panel are included.  Explore with Info --> Repository.

I have a subsystem named "Today"  It contains 1 file, Today/Rsrc/Menues.odc  I edit this file frequently.  A suggested entry is in the startup reading.

There is a bug, and I need help from the community.  After I LogIt to timestamp the current task and start a new one, the Panel stops updating.  When I walk the output from Info --> Global Variables things are all in order.

I am sure it is a simple fix, after hours of effort, but I am stumped, and have to travel for a few days anyway.

Although portable, this is running under:
